Autocharge is implemented by a group of high quality fast charging operators in Europe.

# Why was Autocharge created?

It is key that EVs can drive throughout Europe. The mission of Autocharge is to ensure that recharging on European trips with an EV is practical, affordable and reliable.

Autocharge was founded in 2016 to create a high quality European network of fast charging stations open to all EVs. The most important goal of Autocharge is interoperability between members. Interoperability includes common quality standards, communication protocols and presentation of information.

Autocharge implementors will focus initially on bilateral (peer to peer) roaming agreements between members with high quality networks by implementing open standards such as OCPI.
