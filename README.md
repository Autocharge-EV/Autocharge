The Open Fastcharging Alliance (OFA) is a European premium network of fast charging stations. This network is open to all EVs. It is clear by now that all major car brands are working on electric cars that can go at least 400 km. It is key that these cars can recharge throughout Europe with sufficiently high power. The goal of the OFA is to make sure long distance electric driving is practical, affordable, easy and reliable.

The Alliance will focus initially on bilateral (peer to peer) roaming agreements between members with high quality networks by implementing open standards such as OCPI.

The Open Fast Charging Alliance members are:
 
Fastned (The Netherlands)
Gr√∏nn Kontakt (Norway)
GOtthard FASTcharge (Switzerland)
Smatrics (Austria)
Sodetrel (France)
 
The OFA is open to new members who meet the criteria set out in MEMBERSHIP-CRITERIA.
