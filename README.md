The Open Fastcharging Alliance (OFA) is a European premium network of fast charging stations, founded in 2016. This network is open to all EVs. 

It is key that EVs can recharge throughout Europe with sufficiently high power. The goal of the OFA is to make sure long distance electric driving is practical, affordable, easy and reliable.

The Alliance will focus initially on bilateral (peer to peer) roaming agreements between members with high quality networks by implementing open standards such as OCPI.
 
The OFA is open to new members who meet the criteria set out in membership-criteria.md

The current Open Fast Charging Alliance members can be found in members.md
