The Open Fastcharging Alliance (OFA) is a group of high quality fast charging operators in Europe.

# Why was OFA created?

It is key that EVs can drive throughout Europe. The mission of OFA is to ensure that recharging on European trips with an EV is practical, affordable and reliable.

OFA was founded in 2016 to create a high quality European network of fast charging stations open to all EVs. The most important goal of OFA is interoperability between members. Interoperability includes common quality standards, communication protocols and presentation of information.

The Alliance will focus initially on bilateral (peer to peer) roaming agreements between members with high quality networks by implementing open standards such as OCPI.
